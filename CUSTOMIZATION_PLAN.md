# Customization Plan

## Phase 1 Permission System

Phase 1 adds a minimal Python-side permission layer before existing tool
boundary and capability checks. The new middleware lives in
`src/openjarvis/security/permissions.py` and introduces:

- `PermissionLevel` for coarse request levels: read-only, safe action,
  confirmed execution, and dangerous.
- `PermissionRequest` and `PermissionDecision` dataclasses for a stable
  decision contract.
- `PermissionMiddleware`, which classifies tools by name, inspects
  `shell_exec` commands for dangerous patterns, supports dry-run decision
  checks, and appends JSONL audit records to
  `~/.openjarvis/logs/permissions.log`.

`ToolExecutor.execute()` now calls the middleware immediately after JSON
argument parsing and before boundary guard checks, RBAC capability checks,
taint checks, legacy confirmation, and `tool.execute()`. Dangerous requests
are denied before execution. Confirmed requests reuse the existing interactive
confirmation callback so tools that already set `requires_confirmation=True`
do not prompt twice.

Deferred work remains intentionally untouched in this phase:

- no Rust executor changes
- no MCP streaming bypass changes
- no broader tool-system refactor

## Phase 2 Server Streaming And MCP Gate

Phase 2 closes the Python server streaming bypass where tool calls emitted by
`engine.stream_full()` could execute directly in
`src/openjarvis/server/agent_manager_routes.py` without going through
`ToolExecutor.execute()`.

The server now performs a minimal permission check before both direct MCP
adapter execution and server-created tool execution. The request includes the
tool name, parsed arguments, agent id, and `source="server_streaming"` metadata.
Dangerous requests are denied, and requests that require confirmation are
blocked unless a future route supplies an explicit user approval path.

The server no longer uses unconditional
`confirm_callback=lambda _prompt: True` approvals in this module. The MCP
adapter path remains otherwise unchanged; Phase 2 intentionally does not
redesign streaming, MCP discovery, or the broader tool system.
